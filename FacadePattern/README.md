<h1>Facade Design Pattern</h1>
<p>
	Facade Design Pattern : As per the GOF definition, Facade Pattern states that we need to “Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.” This pattern Falls under the category of Structural Design Pattern and is also known as Wrapper. 
</p>
<p>
	Implementation Guidelines : We need to use Facade Design Pattern when 
We want to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem. Subsystems often get more complex as they evolve. 
There are many dependencies between clients and the implementation classes of an abstraction. 
We want to layer the subsystems. Use a facade to define an entry point to each subsystem level.
